## 📘 Overview

The Personal Finance Tracker (PFT) is a cross-platform Flutter application that helps individuals record transactions, manage bills, analyze expenses, and monitor financial health from a single interface. The project intentionally focuses on educational clarity: the codebase demonstrates clean architecture principles, modern UI/UX, Firebase integration, and offline-first patterns suitable for student projects and professional portfolios.

### Objectives
- Provide a practical case study for Flutter + Firebase driven applications.
- Demonstrate end-to-end mobile app delivery (design, development, deployment).
- Serve as starter material for coursework, documentation practice, and code reviews.

### Success Metrics
- **Reliability:** Seamless auth + persistent sessions after app restarts.
- **Productivity:** Sub-5 second cold start, <2 second major navigation transitions.
- **Data Integrity:** Transactions synced across devices within 1 second (Wi-Fi).

- **Authentication flow:** `AuthGate` listens to Firebase auth stream, then defers to `PasscodeScreen` when local lock is enabled.
- **Data flow:** Transactions, bills, and categories are stored locally (SQLite) for offline use, then mirrored to Cloud Firestore per authenticated user.
- **Images:** Uploaded to Cloudinary with signed URLs and cache-busting headers to prevent stale profile photos.
- **Notifications:** Managed through `flutter_local_notifications` with bill reminders scheduled from SQLite data.

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### 1. System Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.22+
- Dart SDK 3.4+
- Android Studio / Xcode /VS Code
- Firebase project with Auth + Firestore enabled
- Cloudinary account for media storage

### 2. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SingasonSimon/PFT.git
cd PFT
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration
1. Create/Select Firebase project.
2. Enable Email/Password Authentication.
3. Add Android app → download `google-services.json` → place in `android/app/`.
4. (Optional) Add iOS app → place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`.
5. Create Cloud Firestore database (test mode for development).

**Security rules (production baseline):**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Cloudinary Credentials
Update `lib/helpers/config.dart`:
```dart
class AppConfig {
  static const cloudinaryCloudName = 'your_cloud_name';
  static const cloudinaryApiKey = 'your_api_key';
  static const cloudinaryApiSecret = 'your_api_secret';
}
```

### 5. Run
```bash
flutter run               # auto device
flutter run -d chrome     # web (if enabled)
flutter run -d <device>   # specific emulator/phone
```

### 6. Production Builds
```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
flutter build ios --release
```

## 🔬 Quality Assurance

| Area | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static analysis | `flutter analyze` | Lint clean before PRs |
| Unit / widget tests | `flutter test` | Expand coverage for regressions |
| Integration tests | `flutter test integration_test` | Optional, not yet scripted |
| Formatting | `dart format .` | Enforced in CI/CD flow |

**Manual QA checklist**
- [ ] Login → logout → login flow without app restart delays
- [ ] Add/Edit/Delete transaction while offline then reconnect
- [ ] Category creation prevents duplicates and clears state
- [ ] Bill reminder fires at scheduled time (use test notification)
- [ ] Profile photo persists after closing and reopening app
- [ ] PDF report export from Reports tab

---

## 🧭 Operational Playbook

### Troubleshooting
| Scenario | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Login spinner never stops | Confirm Firebase credentials + internet. Check `login_screen.dart` for `_isLoading` states. |
| Profile image reverts | Ensure Cloudinary credentials are set and device clock is correct (signature uses timestamp). |
| Infinite loading dialogs | Use `ValueNotifier<bool>` pattern. Verify buttons disabled when `isLoading == true`. |
| Firestore permission errors | Update security rules or confirm user UID matches document path. |
| Gradle Java version warnings | Project targets Java 17. Re-run `flutter clean` if migrating from older SDK. |

### Maintenance Tasks
- Rotate Cloudinary credentials annually.
- Review Firebase security rules quarterly.
- Audit shared preferences & SQLite migrations before major releases.
- Regenerate launcher icons after branding updates (`flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`).
